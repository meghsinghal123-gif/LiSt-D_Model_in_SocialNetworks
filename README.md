This project aims to develop a diffusion model for weighted social networks, addressing a gap in traditional models that typically only consider the binary state of relationships between nodes. While existing models treat edges as simply existing or not, real-world social networks are inherently weighted, with edge weights reflecting the strength of the link between connecting nodes. To better capture these dynamics, we propose the Link Strength Diffusion (LiSt-D) model, which incorporates the strength of shared relation to determine the probability of diffusion between social actors.
